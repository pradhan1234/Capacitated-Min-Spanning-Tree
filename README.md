# Capacitated Minimum Spanning Tree

Implement the CMST problem.

1. The modified Kruskalâ€™s algorithm
2. The Esau-Williams Algorithm
Compare the results with graphs of various sizes (node/edge combinations).  There are no parallel edges.

Your program will take as input

1. vertices and
2. costs of each edge
3. any other data (as discussed in the class example)
You may create a graph (incident matrix or Adjacency Matrix or adjacency list).

Run the program for at least 4 configurations.

Your submission should consist of

1. Your code
2. Screen shot of each run of the program for the 4 graphs
3. Report describing your implementation and results - comparison between the two algorithms.
